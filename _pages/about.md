### Currently I'm an adjunct professor  
of financial engineering at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.  

### Previously  
I was a portfolio manager at several hedge funds, including Millennium, Diamond Notch, and Mariner-Tricadia.  I traded mostly credit derivatives (credit default swaps and synthetic CDOs), and also some cash bonds and equities.  Before that I was a CLO structurer at Toronto Dominion Securities in New York.  I started working in finance as a quantitative analyst in risk management.  

### Teaching  
I teach graduate courses in Applications of R in Finance, and Algorithmic Portfolio Management Using the R language.  
My lecture slides can be found here: [lecture slides](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bxzva1I0t63vVGEtaXNIY1JMa00){:target="_blank"}  
The source materials for generating the lecture slides are available on GitHub (.Rnw and .Rmd files): [lecture materials on GitHub](https://github.com/algoquant/lecture_slides){:target="_blank"}  
I have developed interactive courses on DataCamp for teaching the <a style="font-family: Courier Bold"> R </a> programming language:

### Research  
I'm interested in systematic investing strategies and high(er) frequency (intraday) trading strategies.  
I'm also interested in the applications of machine learning techniques to algorithmic trading.  
I primarily use the <a style="font-family: Courier Bold"> R </a> programming language for my research.

### R programs and packages
In the course of my research and teaching, I have developed scripts and packages for the <a style="font-family: Courier Bold"> R </a> programming language.  Links to my <a style="font-family: Courier Bold"> R </a> programming resources can be found here:
