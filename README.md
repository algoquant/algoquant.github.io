### Website architecture

The website code is written in *markdown*, *HTML*, *CSS*, *YAML*, and [*liquid*](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).
The website runs on several different types of files: 

* the website parameters and settings are in the *\_config.yml* file (written in YAML) in the *root* directory,  
* the parameters for the Jekyll processor are in the *Gemfile* file in the *root* directory,  
* the website contents are written in markdown and R Markdown files collected in the *\_pages* and *\_posts* directories,  
* the page layouts are written in HTML files collected in the *\_layouts* and *\_includes* directories,  
* the page designs are in CSS files collected in the *stylesheets* directory,  
The markdown and HTML files also contain [liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) code for referencing website parameters and settings.
